# Welcome to the Doc Side of the Moon!

I'm pretty sure nobody will get this far, but in case you're here, this is the repository of my personal/professional blog, authored (mostly) in Markdown and served via Jekyll on GitHub Pages. Neat, eh?

# Theme based on Hyde

Hyde is a theme built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setupâ€”just download and start the Jekyll server. See [the Poole usage guidelines](https://github.com/poole/poole#usage) for how to install and use Jekyll.

# Talk to me

Please open issues for anything troublesome you run into here.
