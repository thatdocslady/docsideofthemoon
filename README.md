# Welcome to the Doc Side of the Moon!

I'm pretty sure nobody will get this far, but in case you're here, this is the repository of my personal/professional blog, authored (mostly) in Markdown and served via Jekyll on GitHub Pages. Neat, eh?

# Thank you Jekyll Now

This repository is a fork of a great template for Jekyll sites called **Jekyll Now**. Thanks to the collaborative spirit of 
the open-source communities, I was able to fork and customize the site without installing or configuring Jekyll from scratch.

Check out the [Jekyll Now GitHub repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), which has a handy-dandy quickstart.
