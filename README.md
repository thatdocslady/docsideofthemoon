# # Welcome to the Doc Side of the Moon!

I'm pretty sure nobody will get this far, but in case you're here, this is the repository of my personal/professional blog, authored (mostly) in Markdown and served via Jekyll on GitHub Pages. Neat, eh?

# Theme based on Hydeout

This repository implements the [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) theme for Jekyll websites. Thanks for the clean and easy to maintain design!

# Talk to me

Please open issues for anything troublesome you run into here. I'm not a web designer so just keep that in mind ;)

If you have docs questions, need a docs talk at your conference, yearn to teach your developers how to write better docs, or just want to just say hi, you're welcome to send an email to [docs@docsideofthemoon.com](mailto:docs@docsideofthemoon.com).
