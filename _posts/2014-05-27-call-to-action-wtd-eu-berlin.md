I love the internet. I really do. It is a magical catalyst for all things awesome to happen in double-quick time...

I wanted to go to [EuroPython](https://ep2014.europython.eu/en/ "EuroPython 2014") in Berlin. For various reasons, that will not happen. But then I found out about another exciting event dubbed [Open Knowledge Festival](http://2014.okfestival.org/ "Open Knowledge Festival 2014") (or OKFestival, as they're known around the social-media-sphere). Also in Berlin. During the week before EuroPython. O RLY? They just published their very cool-looking programme, and a motto that seems much more relevant to my interests.

So yesterday, I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/thatdocslady/status/470620445533028352 "My shout-out tweet") a shout-out to my [\#writethedocs](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23writethedocs&src=savs "#writethedocs on Twitter") buddies to see if anyone was planning to attend OKFestival, and found out that [Kristof van Tomme](https://twitter.com/kvantomme "Kristof on Twitter") (remember my impromptu lightning talk partner at WTD EU? that guy!) was actually thinking of going to EuroPython instead of OKFestival.

And then magic happened:

> [@OKFestival](https://twitter.com/OKFestival) [@writethedocs](https://twitter.com/writethedocs) [@thatdocslady](https://twitter.com/thatdocslady) actually, what about doing a mini [\#writethedocs](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23writethedocs&src=hash) event in Berlin as a fringe event?

> [@kvantomme](https://twitter.com/kvantomme) haha it seems that we suffered similar fate from two different sources. Maybe get a meetup fringe event on the weekend between?

I really do love the internet.

So we set up a video call for last night, and I brought in [Troy Howard](https://twitter.com/thoward37 "Troy on Twitter") (one of the main Write the Docs organizers) to brainstorm ideas and see if we want to make it happen. That email was quite hilarious: "Quick! We need to have a meeting about a Write the Docs conference in Berlin! No time to explain, just get on the call!"

Initially I was thinking of an afternoon meetup, a few talks and an evening outing, low-key and casual. Well, the guys apparently had bigger plans in mind (and the experience to back it up, so I trust them implicitly). What started in my mind as a casual meetup ended up morphing into a full-blown 2-day unconference!

Have I mentioned that I love the internet!?!?!?!

We're working on crossing all the t's and dotting all the i's (we ARE documentarians after all), but in the meantime you can sign up to receive registration information and other fun news right here:

I'm really excited about this, it's the first event that I'm helping to organize, and I'm super-honored to work with Kristof and Troy with all their experience and talent under the Write the Docs flag, which has become my home in the tech community.

Hope to see you all there! Docs or it didn't happen!
