<p><em>Having returned to civilization a few days ago from a 3-week no-computer-no-phone-no-work vacation (the first in many years) to the beaches of Brazil, I'm ready to welcome 2015 with a big hug and the highest of fives!</em></p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/i-request-the-highest-of-fives-himym.gif" alt="highest of fives" /></p>
<p>So far it looks like it's going to be a good year, lots of cool projects at work and beyond: </p>
<p>In a few weeks I'll be kicking off the new year at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/" target="_blank">FOSDEM</a> (I can't believe it's been a whole year since last FOSDEM, which was my first ever open source event!). If I'm not attending talks, I'll be loitering around the Fedora/NixOS/ElasticSearch tables. Ping me if you're around!</p>
<p>On the following week, I'll be co-running the first <a href="http://djangogirls.org/brno/" target="_blank">Django Girls</a> programming workshop in Brno (co-located with <a href="http://devconf.cz/" target="_blank">DevConf.cz</a> and packed full of awesome to welcome these motivated and talented women to the geeksphere).</p>
<p>Once those two events are over, I'll be diving head-first into co-organizing the next <a href="http://conf.writethedocs.org/" target="_blank">Write the Docs EU</a> conference, planned to take place in Prague around early-mid September. Venue leads are already being pursued, and this time no cancellations allowed! </p>
<p>I'd also like to take this opportunity and mention that I'm going to be expanding this blog's scope to include non-event posts, since it seems that it's harder to maintain a steady writing flow unless I attend an event every week (not that I would object, but yours truly still has a day job!).</p>
<p>I'll probably start small, blurting out words here and there about doc stuff, agile stuff, FOSS stuff and community stuff. I'd just like to try and get my blogging chops back in shape, hopefully it'll work out! </p>
<p>Bring it on, 2015!!! </p>
<p>Also, Brazil:</p>
