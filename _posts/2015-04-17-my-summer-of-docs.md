After teasing you all in the last few weeks on Twitter (like [here](https://twitter.com/thatdocslady/status/580451916049698817), [here](https://twitter.com/thatdocslady/status/580472574632693761), [here](https://twitter.com/thatdocslady/status/583620756136980480), and [here](https://twitter.com/thatdocslady/status/586863480222969856)), and it seems that all that was up in the air was finally settled this week, so here are the official docs lady news!

Enter OpenStack, stage left
---------------------------

As some of you may already know, I've been searching for my next tech writing adventure some time now. After considering many options (within and outside of Red Hat), I decided to accept an offer to [join the Red Hat OpenStack Platform documentation team](https://twitter.com/thatdocslady/status/587917796690022400).

This is a very exciting transition for me; having worked in middleware for over 4 years (even before joining Red Hat), I felt that I needed a new challenge, and OpenStack presents many technological innovations and complexities that I can't wait to sink my teeth into!

Next week I'll start my training, so you can expect plenty of tweets and posts about my n00b experiences. And yes, I'll be collecting ideas for doc talks and workshops aimed at OpenStack, so look out for that OpenStack docs lady in your next Python event, and do tell me if you have suggestions or ideas!

Docs in Prague or it didn't happen!
-----------------------------------

After much research, negotiations, and English-Czech translations-of-emails, we have secured a venue for the 2nd Write the Docs EU conference in Prague, Czech Republic. This means we could finally [announce the dates](https://twitter.com/writethedocs/status/589078941832458240) today: **August 31 - September 1, 2015**!

Needless to say, I'm extremely pleased with how the conference is shaping, and I'm also happy to welcome my fellow documentarians [Jessica Rose](https://twitter.com/jesslynnrose) and [Samuel Wright](https://twitter.com/plaindocs) to the EU org team! And yes, they're just as crazy as I am. It's a requirement when you're working with me!

In the meantime, you can catch me at the upcoming [Write the Docs NA](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2015/) conference in Portland, Oregon, on May 17-19, where I will be lending a helping hand and causing trouble at the same time. Just call me Schrödinger's docs lady.

Django Girls returns to EuroPython 2015
---------------------------------------

The Django Girls project is extremely close to my heart; from graduating from the [first workshop](http://docsideofthemoon.com/2014/08/05/django-girls-europython-2014/ "Django Girls @ EuroPython 2014 – Girl-power to geek-power") at last year's EuroPython, to co-organizing the [first Brno workshop](http://docsideofthemoon.com/2015/02/18/django-girls-brno-devconf-cz-2015/ "Django Girls Brno @ DevConf.cz 2015") last February, I've witnessed with pride how the program grew and blossomed to [countless workshops](http://djangogirls.org/events/) all over the world.

And now we're about to come full circle as we return to the conference where it all started. Despite (or in spite of) the recent [internet-upheaval](https://twitter.com/DjangoGirlsEP15/status/586100476275490816) surrounding the EP organizing team, we [launched our website and opened applications](http://djangogirls.org/europython2015/) yesterday?

I'm so blessed to have an opportunity to help make the open source communities a welcoming and safe place for all women, one cupcake at a time! Oh, and I also submitted 3 different doc sessions (a talk, a workshop, and a help desk), so it should be a busy conference!

But when do you sleep, lady?!?!
-------------------------------

[Tuesdays](https://twitter.com/thatdocslady/status/580377308919422976). And some [Saturdays](https://twitter.com/thatdocslady/status/586911949218312192). Also, [coffee naps](http://www.vox.com/2014/8/28/6074177/coffee-naps-caffeine-science) rock.
