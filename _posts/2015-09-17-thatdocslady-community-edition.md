After nearly 7 years of professional technical writing, I'm embarking on my next adventure in Red Hat as the [new community lead for the oVirt project](http://community.redhat.com/blog/2015/09/welcome-to-the-new-ovirt-community-lead/).

Surprised? Curious? Read on :-)

Those who've known me for a while might remember that I have a tendency to reinvent myself every few years. Sleep is overrated.

From my first career as a TV production manager and stage producer, to my second career as a technical writer, I always had absolute commitment to the path I chose but tried to keep an open mind to new directions, and never stopped developing myself.

Now, nearly 7 years after I joined the geeksphere and 2 years after discovering the wonderful world of open source software, I found myself at an interesting crossroads. What started as off-hours activities turned first into a new passion, and now into my third career.

This week I swapped my documentation hat for a community hat (still a red hat!) as the community lead for the [Open Virtualization (oVirt)](http://www.ovirt.org/Home) project. oVirt is the FOSS project that [Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV)](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/virtualization/enterprise-virtualization) is based on, and it's got all the tech (KVM, libvirt, Wildfly, Python, oh my!) as well as a solid user and developer base that I'm looking forward to meet and work with. 

This is an unexpected turn of events for me, but I am thrilled to have the opportunity to reboot my organize-all-the-things-and-meet-all-the-people skills in a new context, and although I am transitioning from docs-for-a-living to community-for-a-living, my docs training will surely not go to waste.

Documentation was my first home in IT; where I grew up, so to speak. And you never forget the place where you grew up. So, since I can't help myself, I will now celebrate this milestone with (you guessed it by now) release notes! For the lolz! Docs or it didn't happen! Community or it won't happen!

**ThatDocsLady 2.0 Release Notes**
----------------------------------

ThatDocsLady 2.0 (Community Edition) is based on ThatDocsLady 1.0 (Documentation Edition). It includes major refactoring to existing features, as well as new production-ready features and resolved issues.

### **Revision History**

ThatDocsLady was originally developed as a technical writing solution. The Beta version was released in February 2009 by an Israeli software vendor, and in October 2013 version 1.0 was released to production in Czech Republic as a part of the Red Hat Content Services subscription.

After version 1.0 was released, analytics showed a surprising potential to re-purpose ThatDocsLady for open source community building deployments. 

To prepare for version 2.0, ThatDocsLady experienced a major refactoring of skills and knowledge in a development environment while still operating all official features in production. Some features were deprecated to conserve mental resources and to prevent burnout, and the patching mechanism now includes a fail-fast-fix-fast rolling upgrade module. 

Since ThatDocsLady 1.0 did not include release notes, the following section lists a summary of production-ready and technical preview features, as well as known issues for version 1.0, to assist with comparison between the two versions and to optimize the upgrade process.

#### **Resolved issues**

-   Command-line functionality was improved to include bash and Git operations
-   Documentation formats now include AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, and Markdown
-   Perpetual Optimism Module is now monitored by the cross-cultural communications component and energy levels (should be) stabilized

#### **Known issues**

-   Geographical location does not support frequent travel, on the roadmap for version 2.1, Prague Edition (to be released December 2015)
-   Documentation workshops support is reduced but not deprecated, to be deployed on a case-by-case basis using Write the Docs plug-in

My new roadmap is clear, and I can't wait to put on my walking shoes and hit the road! I will continue to maintain this blog for my off-hours documentation adventures, but for community posts you might want to check out [Red Hat Community News](http://community.redhat.com/), as I'll be making most of my noise there.

Yours,
 That (community) docs lady
