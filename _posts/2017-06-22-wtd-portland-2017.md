![Write the Docs Portland 2017]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/wtd-pdx-2017.jpg)

Last month I traveled once again to help with [Write the Docs Portland 2017](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/),
and once again I was floored by how friendly, inclusive, and simply happy our documentarians are!

This year the conference drew nearly 400 attendees from all over North America, plus a good number of visitors
from across the various ponds. We had presentations, unconference sessions, workshops, and sprints, and it was
all held in a pleasant and enthusiastic atmosphere at the Crystal Ballroom.

I had a great time watching talks, listening in to unconference sessions, and at the end of the conference I
even gave a lightning talk together with [Rose Williams](https://twitter.com/ZelWms) about the
[sprung dance floor](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rmrkHKMlCUBQnem8ukbVjU_TY8qmGeXUBT8Ks1BnRLU/edit#slide=id.p) at the Crystal!

In case you couldn't attend the conference or simply want to reminisce, check out the [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZAeFn6dfHpkBld-70TsOoYToM3CaTxRC),

[Tom Johnson](http://idratherbewriting.com/2017/05/23/write-the-docs-and-the-battle-against-vendor-evil/) and
[Andrea Kao](http://eirinikos.github.io/2017/06/02/write-the-docs-na/).

Thank you to all who attended, spoke, sponsored, and volunteered. I am truly honored to be a part of this
community and I look forward to catching up with the European documentarians in the [Prague conference](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/) in September!

Yours,

That Docs Lady
