Ok, actually it was my first *ever* podcast. As much as it might surprise some of you, this is one type of performance I have little-to-no experience with. Thankfully, the other types seemed to help me along as I braved the virtual panel together with [Eric Holscher](https://twitter.com/ericholscher). Although, let's face it -- the hour-long podcast was basically an excited chat about my favorite community with some of my favorite people, so time flew and we had a blast.

It was really interesting to get into the roots of Write the Docs again, remembering where we all started, realizing how much we've accomplished as a community, and teasing a bit with future plans. Whenever I have conversations like this with people I get supercharged with gratitude that I get to be a part of this family, and now there's documented evidence of this type of conversation, which I hope will inspire others to step up and take part in this great documentarian adventure.

Thank you so much to [Chris Ward](https://twitter.com/ChrisChinch), [Jared Morgan](https://twitter.com/jaredmorgs), and [Tom Johnson](https://twitter.com/tomjohnson) for running this fun and useful podcast. I encourage more documentarians to jump on the podcast train -- Got something exciting to share about docs? Go talk to the podcasters!

Check out the detailed description, read the list of questions, and download the MP3 of the session [from the podcast page](http://podcast.writethedocs.org/2017/12/13/founding-principles-of-write-the-docs/).

What a lovely way to wrap up 2017!

See you in 2018,
