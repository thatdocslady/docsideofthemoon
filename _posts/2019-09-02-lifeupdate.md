_My alter-egos hard at work. Yes, it's the same stage!_

Oh hello there, it's been a while. Life is a funny thing, and recently I had some time to consider mine and make some changes, so here's a quick update on what's been going on.

### Why you no blog no more?

After my last blog post in the spring of 2018, my life picked up speed quite suddenly but not in the conference space. I found myself spending more and more of my spare time on [other projects](http://missmikeymay.com/), so I trimmed down my conference travel in the name of well-being and work-life balance. 

Since this blog was mainly used for conference recaps, I simply didn't have that much stuff to update. I do have to mention my [keynote at DjangoCon Europe 2019](https://2019.djangocon.eu/talks/docs-or-it-didnt-happen-with-qa/), which was a wonderful honor to share knowledge and inspire people who inspired me in my open-source journey!

### So where in the world are you?

Besides working and traveling, I dedicated a good chunk of time this year to settling down more in Prague, trying to make it my home. Back in June of this year, I finally got an opportunity to go to the next level when I received my permanent residence in Czech Republic. 

Aside from the obvious relief of having unlimited residence in my favorite country and continent, the biggest impact was that I am no longer required to have a full-time job in order to maintain my residency. 

Why does this matter? In the last few years I've been trying to improve my internal "burnout detector" so that I don't end up crashing again, and I realized that now that my residence no longer depends on employment, I can finally make a change that I was never able to make before: 

As of next week, I'll be reducing my Red Hat job to 3 days per week. My work days will be Tuesday-Thursday, and Mondays/Fridays will be freed up to pursue other projects.

### What's your life going to look like now?

As the great poet said, "I'm not dead yet!". I'll still continue my Write the Docs conference work, and whatever time I won't spend on Red Hat or Write the Docs, I will be dedicating to music, which has grown enough to be considered an actual part-time job, rather than a time-consuming hobby.

I'm looking forward to this experiment - for the first time in my adult life, I won't have a full-time job as a focal point, and I'm curious to explore this type of balance. I hope this way I can keep investing in all my beloved projects while gaining more free time to relax (something else that I've been practicing). 

Managing work-life balance is a skill that I have to practice all the time, because the underlying personality traits and environmental forces that drove me to my previous burnout will always be there. But I can see improvement over time, which is very encouraging!

Stay healthy, folks. Take care of yourselves. I'll blog here as often as I get inspired, but know that I'm alive and well and working all the time towards a more peaceful and joyous existence.

Yours, 

-That Docs Lady
