Oh hello there, it's been a while. Life is a funny thing, and recently I had some time to consider mine and make some changes, so here's a quick update on what's been going on:

After the last blog post, my life picked up speed quite suddenly but not in the conference space. I found myself spending more and more of my spare time on [other projects](http://missmikeymay.com/), so I trimmed down my conference travel in the name of well-being and work-life balance. 

Since this blog was mainly used for conference recaps, I simply didn't have that much stuff to update, although I must mention [my keynote at DjangoCon Europe 2019](https://2019.djangocon.eu/talks/docs-or-it-didnt-happen-with-qa/), which was a wonderful honor to share knowledge and inspire people who inspired me in my open-source journey!

The most important milestone I wanted to share is that I got approved for permanent residence in Czech Republic in June of this year. Aside from the obvious relief of having unlimited residence in my favorite country and continent, the biggest impact was the fact that I am no longer required to have a full-time job in order to maintain my residency. 

In the last few years I've been trying to improve my internal "burnout detector" so that I don't end up crashing again, and I realized that now that my residence no longer depends on employment, I can finally make a move I was never able to do before: 

As of next week, I'll be reducing my Red Hat job to 3 days per week. I'll still continue my Write the Docs work, and my music work is big enough that I can consider it an actual part-time job, rather than a time-consuming hobby.

I'm looking forward to this experiment; this is the first time in my adult life that I won't have a full-time job, and it's a different balancing act that I'm curious to explore. I hope this way I can keep investing in all my beloved projects but still have free time to relax (something else that I've been practicing on). 

Managing work-life balance and well-being is a skill that I have to practice all the time, because the underlying personality traits and environmental forces that drove me to my previous burnout will always be there. But I'm working on it, and I can see improvement over time, which is very encouraging!

Stay healthy, folks. Take care of yourselves. I'll blog here as often as I get inspired, but know that I'm alive and well and working all the time towards a more peaceful and joyous existence.
