Oh hello there, it's been a while. Life is a funny thing, and recently I had some time to consider mine and make some changes, so here's a quick update on what's been going on.

## Why you no blog no more?

After the last blog post, my life picked up speed quite suddenly but not in the conference space. I found myself spending more and more of my spare time on [other projects](http://missmikeymay.com/), so I trimmed down my conference travel in the name of well-being and work-life balance. 

Since this blog was mainly used for conference recaps, I simply didn't have that much stuff to update, although I must mention [my keynote at DjangoCon Europe 2019](https://2019.djangocon.eu/talks/docs-or-it-didnt-happen-with-qa/), which was a wonderful honor to share knowledge and inspire people who inspired me in my open-source journey!

## So where in the world are you?

Besides working and traveling, I dedicated a lot of time this year to settling down more in Prague and in Czech Republic, making it my home. Happily, now I can pursue it even more: After more than 5 years of living and working here, I finally got my permanent residence last June. 

Aside from the obvious relief of having unlimited residence in my favorite country and continent, the biggest change was that I am no longer required to have a full-time job in order to maintain my residency. 

Why does this matter? In the last few years I've been trying to improve my internal "burnout detector" so that I don't end up crashing again, and I realized that now that my residence no longer depends on employment, I can finally make a move I was never able to do before: As of next week, I'll be reducing my Red Hat job to 3 days per week.

## What's your life going to look like now?

As the great poet said, "I'm not dead yet!". I'll still continue my Write the Docs conference work and there are a lot of exciting plans for the comings years. Whatever time I won't spend on Red Hat or Write the Docs, I will be dedicating to music, which has grown enough to be considered an actual part-time job, rather than a time-consuming hobby.

I'm looking forward to this experiment! For the first time in my adult life, I won't have a full-time job as a focal point, and it's a different balancing act that I'm curious to explore. I hope this way I can keep investing in all my beloved projects while gaining more free time to relax (something else that I've been practicing). 

Managing work-life balance and well-being is a skill that I have to practice all the time, because the underlying personality traits and environmental forces that drove me to my previous burnout will always be there. But I'm working on it, and I can see improvement over time, which is very encouraging!

Stay healthy, folks. Take care of yourselves. I'll blog here as often as I get inspired, but know that I'm alive and well and working all the time towards a more peaceful and joyous existence.

Yours, 

-That Docs Lady
