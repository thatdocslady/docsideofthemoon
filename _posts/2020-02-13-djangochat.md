First post of the year, and it's a fun one! I had the pleasure of participating in the lovely Django Chat podcast hosted by the equally lovely humans [Will Vincent](https://twitter.com/wsv3000) and [Carlton Gibson](https://twitter.com/carltongibson).

This special documentation episode elaborates on my [keynote at DjangoCon Europe 2019](https://2019.djangocon.eu/talks/docs-or-it-didnt-happen-with-qa/), and we geek out about everything from empathy for readers, how much code would a writer need to know, and the possibility of enlisting a Docs Fellow for the Django project.

Thanks so much Will and Carlton for inviting me to share my perspective on documentation, and I look forward to great things happening with Django docs!

Yours, 

-That Docs Lady
