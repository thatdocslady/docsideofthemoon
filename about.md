My name is Mikey, but you may call me... That Docs Lady (ta-da!). As such, I document all the things! By day I'm a technical writer for Red Hat, by nights-and-weekends I live an artist's life as a singer, dancer, videographer, and graphic designer. And yes, I document those activities, elsewhere ;)

I've been a technical writer since 2009 and in October 2013 I joined Red Hat and discovered the wonderful world of open-source technology and communities. Since then I've joined the legions of Documentarians at [Write the Docs](http://www.writethedocs.org/), supported women in tech through [Django Girsl](https://djangogirls.org/), and presented at lots of open-source conferences about documentation, community, and DevOps.

In September 2015 I bid my farewell to docs and went to work as a full-time community manager, but after nearly a year on the job I realized that my true passion is for documentation, so as of July 2016 I'm once again documenting all the things, and happy to be back!
