My name is Mikey, but most know me as That Docs Lady. As such, I document all the things! By day I'm a technical writer for Red Hat, by nights-and-weekends I live an artist's life as a singer, dancer, videographer, and graphic designer. And yes, I document those activities, elsewhere :)

I've been a technical writer since 2009 and in October 2013 I became a Red Hatter and discovered the wonderful world of open-source technology and communities. Since then I've joined the legions of Documentarians at [Write the Docs](http://www.writethedocs.org/), supported women in tech through [Django Girsl](https://djangogirls.org/), coached developers on how to write documentation via workshops and doc sprints, and presented at lots of open-source conferences about documentation, community, and DevOps.

In September 2015 I took a left at Albuquerque to work as a full-time community manager, and in July 2016 rolled back into docs with newfound community insight (and a lot of air miles!). Currently I am a community docs writer for [Red Hat Developer Experience](http://developers.redhat.com/) and a conference organizer for [Write the Docs](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/).
