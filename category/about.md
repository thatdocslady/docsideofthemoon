Greetings, fellow geeks!

My name is Mikey, but most know me as That Docs Lady. As such, I love to document all the things!

By day I'm a technical writer for Red Hat OpenStack, by afternoon/evening I'm in the global community team for [Write the Docs](http://www.writethedocs.org/), and by nights-and-weekends I live an artist's life as a singer, dancer, and videographer. And yes, I document those activities, elsewhere :)

I've been a technical writer since 2009 and in October 2013 I became a Red Hatter and discovered the wonderful world of open-source technology and communities. In 2014 I gave my first-ever talk at a conference in Write the Docs Europe, Budapest, and I fell in love. Many talks and conferences soon followed.

I've been fortunate to have been able to also support women in tech through [Django Girsl](https://djangogirls.org/), coach developers on how to write documentation via workshops and doc sprints, and generally enjoy sharing the love of documentation, DevOps, community, and diversity.
